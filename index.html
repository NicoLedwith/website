            Hi, my name is Nico. I have a BS in Computer Engineering from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Welcome to my website! First, a bit about me: I love music, food, and nautre. Music and food inspire me because I can experience what other people have made and incorporate that into my own creations. Nature fascinates me for the exact opposite reason; I know that I can't create nature, and that is what I find so beautiful about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of computing and my future, I am currently looking for a professional career in computer programming. What drives me is a desire to use technology to help <em>all</em> people. While I recognize that technology has brought about many important advances in society, it has incurred a cost. To me, the two biggest issues with the advancement in technology are the effect on nature and its relationship with underrepresented societal groups. Nature has already been significantly harmed, and it will take a lot of work to reverse the effects. Similarly, much more work needs to be done to promote representation within the technology culture. Technology is so powerful, but the lack of representation of women and people of color creates a dangerous power structure. Open conversations about race, gender and humanity need to be core principles of any company working in tech. Moving forward, I will do my best to keep these issues in mind and let them influence my choices in life, work, and love.
