          <h1>LabPal</h1>
          <p>
            LabPal is designed to be used in chemistry labs as a means of instant feedback and verification of students' lab work.
            This fixes the issue of low latency of critical feedback regarding various calculations and data collection during a lab.
            With this new system, students do not have to wait up to a week for TAâ€™s to grade a handwritten lab notebookâ€”
            courses move fast, so should grading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Created under the directive of Dr. Greg Scott at Cal Poly, LabPal was born in early 2015. Eric Burlingame and Cody Jones,
            students at Cal Poly, laid the foundation for the project by configuring <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> with a MySQL. I joined a
            few months later and began development. My completed tasks on LabPal include handling array inputs, allowing students to
            enter X and Y graph data and check metrics like slope, regression and Y-intercept; creating an import & export system
            for rapid creation and sharing of assignments using Excel; integrating WebSockets via
            <a href="http://socketo.me/">Ratchet</a> and <a href="http://crossbar.io/autobahn/">AutobahnJS</a> to allow for push style data updates
            throught the site; creating a polling system which allows professors to ask customized questions and see students' answers in real time.

          <h1>CardSort</h1>
          <p>CardSort is a digitization of a well-implemented card sorting procedure used as a survey tool to explore how humans group data.
            With this service, instructors can measure how effectively students are learning material. This web app comes with data analytics
            tools built in and an option to export data for more in-depth statistics. It is also fully generalized, so it can be used for any subject matter.

          <h1>Pangea</h1>
          <p>How many times have you heard of an event the day after it happened from a friend or collegue and though "wow, I would have loved that, how did
            I not know about this?" Say hello to Pangea, a social events network designed to help you discover the events happening around you. Pangea is centered
            around a map-calender interface, allowing you to find out <em>what</em> is happening and <em>where</em>. The spatial contextualization of event discovery creates an
            incredibly immersive and experiential experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pangea is set to launch in late 2017.

          <h1>BioBand (The Underwearable)</h1>
          <p>
            BioBand is a small clip that sits on your waistband and tracks the changes in color of your skin throughout the day. The motivation behind this device
            is the theory that slight changes in the hue of a person's skin can correlate to changes in health. We are already familiar with this idea: turning pale,
            or turning green, and blushing are all examples of color changes correlating to a change in internal body health. BioBand was a Computer Engineering Capstone project
            designed to capture RGB color data every 30 minutes for 10 seconds at a time. This data was stored on a micro SD card, which was then uploaded to a computer
            for processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was in charge of experimenting with the raw data to dertmine if any useful metrics could be extracted. Inspired by a process called
            photoplethysmogram, having to do with tracking the changes of blood volume in skin, I performed various digital signal processing algorithims to the data
            and was able to produce a beats per minute value. I was able to find the isolate the changes in blood flow by applying an FIR filter
            to the red color data. From this signal, I applied a Fourier Transform to calculate the frequency of blood pumping, which correlated to the BPM. Validation
            was self performed by measuring heart rate by hand and comparing values. All data processing was done in Python.

          <h1>Linear Sim</h1>
          <p>
            Linear Sim is a computational fluid dynamics problem I completed for a systems programming course. The problem was as follows. We divide a stretch of water in to
            X number of cells, each evenly spaced, so that they are all in a row (ie, bordered by each other only on the left and the right). Given the inital temperatures of
            the left most and right most cells of water, what will be the temperatures of each cell every Y amount of time. The left and right cells act as sources, so their
            temperatures will not change, but each cell in between them will be effected by heat transfer at each time interval.
          </p>
          <p>
            As this was a systems programming class in C, the solution to this problem involed forks and pipes. Each cell was a child process, all forked off by the main process.
            The left and right cells contained pipes to their neigbors, wich contained pipes to their neighbors, and so on. At each time interval, temperature data was sent from each
            cell to its neighbors, and each cell had to recalculate its temperature given the new information from its neighbors.
          </p>
          <p>
            This program taught me to design before you code. Jumping into a complex problem like this one without a plan is bound to fail. Drawing diagrams of child processes
            and pipes between them turned out to be extremely useful, as well as thinking about the different behaviors given a different number of cells.

          <h1>Dining Philosophers</h1>
          <p>
            Dining Philosophers is a classic operating systems problem. Five philosphers sit around a dinner table with a large plate of sushi in the middle.
            As they are philosophers, all they do is think or eat. There's a problem though, there are only five chopsticks, one between each philosopher.
            These philosophers haven't figured out the "stab the sushi" method, so they need two chopsticks to eat. If one philosopher is eating, those on either
            side of her cannot eat. These philosphers are also a bit selfish; once one has picked up one chopstick, they won't put it down until they have another
            and have eaten. The issue arrises if each philosopher picks up their left chopstick. They will all be waiting for the philospher to their right to put
            down their chopstick, and since they are sitting in a circle, they are all waiting for each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            This problem is used to model concurrent processes in an operating system. Say two processes need two resources, but each is waiting for the other to
            release the one they need. The system will go into deadlock and freeze. As part of an operating systems course, I implemented a solution to the Dining
            Philosphers problem using semephores and the pthreads library. Careful design work was necessary to avoid deadlock on start and to ensure that deadlock
            did not occur in the middle of the program.
